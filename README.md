# Cognitive Delegation Interface (CDI)

An AI-native decision system where the AI can temporarily decide on behalf of the user — with permission.

## Core Concept

- Assume provisional responsibility
- Explain decisions
- Allow instant override

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- AI: Prompt-based reasoning (LLM-ready)
